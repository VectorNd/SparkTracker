# Project Overview 
This project is a submission for Walmart Sparkathon 2024.A feature that alerts customers via email when a product's price drops below their desired maximum, enhancing customer experience and aiding in product price optimization.

# Problem Statement
How can we enhance customer satisfaction by notifying them when a product's price matches their budget, and simultaneously gather data to optimize product pricing?

# How the Problem Statement is Getting Solved
By allowing customers to set a desired maximum price for a product, the system monitors price changes and sends an email alert when the price drops below the set limit, ensuring customers don't miss out on deals. Additionally, the collected data on desired price points provides valuable insights for optimizing product pricing strategies.
